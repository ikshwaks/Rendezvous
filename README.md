# Rendezvous
Rendezvous is a simple website that makes use of Google Maps JavaScript APIs to suggest places that are convenient to two users.
User is required to input his location and his partner's(who he wishhes to *Rendezvous* with) location. 
Google Maps Autocomplete API suggests places in the text field. Geographical coordinates are then obtained from the place ID of the inputs.
The functionality offered by this rather simple looking website is useful when people want to meet at unfamiliar locations.
